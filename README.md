Whatevernote is a pixel-perfect clone of Evernote.com, with a twist. Create sortable notes and notebooks. Customize your creations with the React Quill text editor toolbar. 
* **Python/Flask** and **React with Redux** power this project.
* User's info is **fetched on login** and stored in redux for **efficiency**.
* **React Quill** text editor engine is configured with a **custom-undo button** to save up to 20 slices of history.
* User **edits are stored in state** during the session and `POST`'ed upon **logout**.
* This clone reflects Evernote's **2021 update** focusing on **improving** weak areas of the UI such as user authentication and the tags system.
